KCemu 0.3.5

  * added emulation of the LC 80 computer (thanks to Holger
    Krull for providing the necessary information at
    www.lc80.de)
  * big internal changes in the display code; there is now
    a generic display layer to simplify the porting to other
    architectures
  * started BeOS port to check the generic display layer --
    not quite usable due to some threading bugs and missing
    user interface
  * renaming of files in tape archives is now possible
  * allow adding .TAP files with multiple files with the same
    name (by renaming the duplicated names)
  * fixed some tape handling bugs
  * fixed initialization bug in the display code

KCemu 0.3.4

  * new switch for kctape to add KC85/1 files (only needed
    for COM files)
  * bugfix for KC85/1 tape files
  * simple sound emulation (still buggy, sound is sometimes
    not turned off) -- requires libSDL
  * implemented IRM switch for KC85/4
  * changed interrupt code to handle daisy chaining
    (makes pharao playable, but still with display errors)

KCemu 0.3.3

  * fixed bug in flash handling (diamonds in digger didn't
    show correctly after reset)
  * fixed tape handling, stop button working again
  * fixed typo that prevented the busdrivers to show up
    in the module window
  * added disk image with CP/M tools from the KC-Club
  * allow compressed disk images in 22DISK format
  * fixed floppy selection when writing data, file copy
    (e.g. from disk B: to disk C:) should now work correctly
  * disk emulation for unix directories (don't try
    to attach directories with many (e.g. > 100)
    or big files!)
  * emulate 4 disks now
  * disk handling partially functional
  * use cppunit for unit tests

KCemu 0.3.2

  * released a debian binary package of KCemu v0.3.2
  * added manpages because the debian packaging system
    requires them
