2002-01-06  Torsten Paul  <Torsten.Paul@gmx.de>

	* released version 0.3.3
	
	* src/libdisk/load_22dsk.c (loader_22dsk_write_sector): 
	added write support
	
	* src/libdisk/load_cdm.c (loader_cdm_write_sector): added
	write support

	* src/ui/gtk/disk.cc: show disks that are installed by
	default as combobox entries

2002-01-05  Torsten Paul  <Torsten.Paul@gmx.de>

	* src/kc/floppy.cc: fixed crash when the emulator tried
	to access a floppy device with no attached floppy

	* src/ui/gtk/ui_gtk*.cc: added/changed status info
	showing the frames per second

	* src/ui/gtk/tape.cc (init): don't set empty popup
	on tape combobox

	* Makefile.am: added the debian package control files to
	the source distribution

	* src/libdisk/load_dir.c: first working disk emulation
	for unix directories (at least if pointed to directories
	with reasonable content - will most likely crash on
	directories with many or big files!)

	* src/kc/fdc_cmd.cc (read_byte): fixed wrong call to
	fetch_next_sector() which came one byte too early

2002-01-03  Torsten Paul  <Torsten.Paul@gmx.de>

	* src/libdisk/load_cdm.c: handles disk format used by the
	yaze CP/M emulator and its disk handling program cdm
	(for now only disks created with the cdm command
	"create disk.img 819200 -b1024 -d127 -o4 -s5" are
	supported - this is the same format as the CAOS disk
	that ships with the D004 floppy system)

	* src/libdisk/load_22dsk.c: handles disk dumps done with
	the 22DISK tool by Sydex

	* src/libdisk/load_dir.c: emulate unix directories as
	CP/M disk

	* src/libdisk/disk.c: moved the file I/O for floppy
	disks into a separate library

	* src/kc/ctc.cc (trigger): don't run interrupt handler
	if interrupts are not enabled! this seems to fix the
	MicroDOS boot hang

2002-01-02  Torsten Paul  <Torsten.Paul@gmx.de>

	* src/kc/kc.cc: added kc87 mode (equals kc85/1 mode with
	color expansion installed), color expansion doesn't show
	up in the module list anymore

	* src/ui/gtk/module.cc: module user interface only displays
	modules for the running computer type

	* include/kc/mod_list.h (class ModuleList): added type field
	for modules that specifies for which computer type the module
	is intended for

	* test/kc/t_cb_list.cc, test/kc/t_ctc.cc: first unit tests
	based on Cppunit

	* src/ui/gtk/disk.cc: user interface now somewhat functional -
	initializastion not correct if disk-images are attached via
	.kcemurc

2002-01-01  Torsten Paul  <Torsten.Paul@gmx.de>

	* src/kc/fdc_cmd.cc: enabled write access

	* src/kc/fdc.cc: now emulate all four floppies and allows
	initialization in .kcemurc

	* src/kc/floppy.cc (attach): fixed missing size calculation of
	the offset table when attaching CDM floppies
	(read_offsets): moved sector offset table into the Floppy class

2001-12-31  Torsten Paul  <Torsten.Paul@gmx.de>

	* src/kc/ctc.cc: main ctc code is now processor independent
	and can be used for the base and the floppy system /
	handling of counter/timer mode changed to be more general
	but needs some test and optimization eventually
	
	* src/kc/z80_fdc.cc, src/kc/ctc_fdc.cc: interrupt handling
	working partially (MicroDOS system clock is running) but there
	seems to be a ctc related problem that locks up the MicroDOS
	system on boot

	* include/ui/ui.h: removed reference to z80.h

2001-12-30  Torsten Paul  <Torsten.Paul@gmx.de>

	* include/kc/z80_fdc.h, src/kc/z80_fdc.cc: moved the floppy
	systems cpu emulation into separate files

	* src/kc/z80.cc: lots of dead code removed

	* test/kc/t_cb_list_1.cc, test/kc/t_cb_list_2.cc: added some
	testcases for the callback code

	* include/kc/cb_list.h, src/kc/cb_list.cc: moved the callback
	handling out of z80.cc so it can also be used for the floppy
	processor emulation

2001-12-30  Torsten Paul  <Torsten.Paul@gmx.de>

	* include/kc/ctc*.h, src/kc/ctc*.cc: added layer between
	core CTC emulation and system (processor) specific calls
	to support the CTC usage in the floppy system emulation

2001-12-29  Torsten Paul  <Torsten.Paul@gmx.de>

	* compile fixes for gcc-3.0.x
	* prepared debian binary release
	* added manpages as required by debian policy

2001-12-28  Torsten Paul  <Torsten.Paul@gmx.de>

	* released version 0.3.2 on SourceForge.net

2001-06-17  Torsten Paul  <Torsten.Paul@gmx.de>

	* registred SourceForge.net project
	
2001-01-22  Torsten Paul  <Torsten.Paul@gmx.de>

	* include/kc/ctc.h, src/kc/ctc.cc: added CTCCallbackInterface that
	allows other classes to register some interresting events of the
	emulated CTC (Timer Value change, Start, Stop, Zero Counter)

2001-01-20  Torsten Paul  <Torsten.Paul@gmx.de>

	* include/kc/pio.h (class PIOCallbackInterface): output callbacks
	now include the value as argument

2001-01-15  Torsten Paul  <Torsten.Paul@gmx.de>

	* src/kc/memory4.cc (Memory4): load RAM-File on init
	(Resource: "Load On Init"), hex number starting with 0x can
	specify load addres; will only work with a patched System ROM
	that doesn't zero all available memory

2000-07-12  Torsten Paul  <Torsten.Paul@gmx.de>

	* src/fileio/load_SSS.c: new loader for raw BASIC files (without
	header bytes and filename)

2000-07-10  Torsten Paul  <Torsten.Paul@gmx.de>

	* src/ui/gtk/tape.cc: Translation of GtkItemFactoryEntries and the
	associated text (without the '_' markers) need to be the same or
	else the retrieving of the widgets will fail!!!

	* src/kc/tape.cc: fixed saving to tape

2000-07-08  Torsten Paul  <Torsten.Paul@gmx.de>

	* src/fileio/load.c: added get_name() function to the loader
	interface

	* src/kc/ctc1.cc, src/ui/gtk/ui_gtk1.cc, src/kc/pio3.cc: changed
	debug code to use libdbg

	* src/fileio/load_BASIC.c (loader_BASIC_load),
	src/fileio/load_TAPE.c (loader_TAPE_load): fixed loaders to
	correctly store the file blocks with the included block number

2000-07-06  Torsten Paul  <Torsten.Paul@gmx.de>

	* src/libtape/kctape.cc (add_file): changed file loading to use
	the fileio library

2000-07-02  Torsten Paul  <Torsten.Paul@gmx.de>

	* src/ui/gtk/ui_gtk.cc (create_main_window): didn't get property
	change events anymore, maybe gtk_widget_set_events() behaves now
	differently or the default event mask is different? - fixed

2000-07-01  Torsten Paul  <Torsten.Paul@gmx.de>

	* src/ui/gtk/module.cc (init): fixed another initialization bug

2000-06-28  Torsten Paul  <Torsten.Paul@gmx.de>

	* src/kc/mod_rom.cc (ModuleROM): fixed initialization bug that
	caused segfaults when leaving the emulator
