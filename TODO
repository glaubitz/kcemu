- don't use tempnam() in ModuleV24::socket_server():
- fix interrupt handling, the hardware daisy chain is not
  honored correctly which breaks some programs (e.g. PHARAO)
- fix tape handling (the tape isn't stopped when the program
  is loaded)
- extend the configuration dialog and save the changed values
- implement display scaling (hmm, maybe use SDL?)
- implement user interface for floppy disks
- implement sound output
- implement wav file reading
