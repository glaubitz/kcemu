Changes:

Wed Nov 19 00:28:16 CET 1997

	added RetiZ80() function for signaling a reti instruction
	to interface circuits

Fri Mar 22 13:31:41 CET 2002

	changed timing for DJNZ from 8 to 13 which is the case
	if the jump is done

Sat Jun 15 18:09:23 CEST 2002

	externalized the calculation of the R register; the LD A,R
	instruction is now reflected to the program using the
	emulation core -- it calls LdRZ80() to get the value of
	the R register
